## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Docker running in the background

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbhayTopno/Contribution-Hub.git
   cd contribution-hub
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**

   **Backend Setup:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit `.env` with your values:

   - `GITHUB_TOKEN`: GitHub personal access token
   - `GOOGLE_CSE_API_KEY`: Google Custom Search Engine API key
   - `GOOGLE_CSE_ID`: Google Custom Search Engine ID

   **Frontend Setup:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Start the Application**

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```

   ‚úÖ Ensure all services show "Healthy" status (backend, frontend, container_backend, container_frontend, container_db).

4. **Database Setup**

   ```bash
   # Run database migrations
   docker exec -it backend python manage.py migrate

   # Fetch GSoC organizations data
   docker exec -it backend python manage.py fetch_gsoc_orgs

   # Fetch GitHub URLs
   docker exec -it backend python manage.py fetch_github_url --limit 105
   ```

   **Note:** The Google Custom Search Engine API has a daily limit of 100-105 requests. You may need to create additional API keys and CSE IDs to scrape remaining GitHub URLs if you exceed this limit.

5. **Access the Application**
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Backend API: `http://localhost:8000`

## API Keys Setup
